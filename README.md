# Non-Rigid Transformation based SLAM

This project is an attempt to implement a new Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) method based on a SLAM approach called "Elastic Fusion" which was proposed by T. Whelan et al. Significance in this SLAM approach is that it uses a method called deformation theory at the backend of the SLAM system in Loop closure or error minimization in the mapping and localization process. In this project, a new SLAM approach that uses 3D point cloud data in the frontend and using deformation theory at the backend is proposed.
