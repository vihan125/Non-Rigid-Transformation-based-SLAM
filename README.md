# Non-Rigid Transformation based SLAM

This project is an attempt to implement a new Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) method based on a SLAM approach called "Elastic Fusion" which was proposed by T. Whelan et al. Significance in this SLAM approach is that it uses a method called deformation theory at the backend of the SLAM system in Loop closure or error minimization in the mapping and localization process. In this project, a new SLAM approach that uses 3D point cloud data in the frontend and using deformation theory at the backend is proposed.

Simulations were done using Gazebo and When doing the simulations for the project two types of indoor environmnets were used to accommadate environments of different natures that a robot may encounter. Environmnets used in the simulations are,
